Creating a newNode with given value(A)
check whether the list is empty(Head== Null)
If it is eampty then set new node-->neXt ==NUll and Head==New node
If it is not eampty the, define a node pointer 'B' and initialize with head
keep moving it to the 'B' to its next node until it reaches to the node after which we want to insert the new node(temp-->data is equal to location)
check whetehr the 'B' is reached to last node or not. if reached then display "given node is not found otherwise move the temp to next node
set NewNode-->next-temp-->next and temp-->next-newNode.
