1)Sequentail access/Random access
2)Static allocation/Dynamic allocation
3)Purpose of getting/putting numbers
4)Usage of the below:

Arrays:
     Array will assign random access
     Array will support dynamic allocation
     we insert and read numbers based on index
     We use to fixed set of records and used for collection of data

Linkedlist:
     Sequential access
     dynamic allocation
     It will be based on the next pointer
     We use it when the size is un-known
     
Stack:
    Sequential access--> we can access only TOP element and the remaining elements will be hidden
    Static allocation LIFO(Last in first out)
    Undo operation in mot of the OS
    
 Queue:
      Sequentail access
      we use FIFO logic here
